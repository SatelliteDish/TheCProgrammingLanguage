### The C Programming Language

This is just going to be my solutions to the challenges presented in the book 'The C Programming Language' by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. I'll put each chapter in it's own subdirectory and each challenge in a the chapter directory. I'll have a makefile for each as well as I need to practice that too.

I will skip some challenges, mostly when it's just to create errors. I don't really like to commit (especially push) code that won't compile and you won't get anything of value from seeing it either.
